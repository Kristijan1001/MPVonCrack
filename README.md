This has bunch of script combined for personal configuration. Most groundwork is from LazyMPV, with some other external scripts credit goes to all those people. 
There are a lot of custom scripts i made. For Example you can double click a torrent file and play it straight in MPV with RealDerbid, no hassle no bs. 

Yes it does need for you to be a bit tech savy, i doubt i will update this in future.

For Real Derbid you need to add your API in the torrent-handler.lua in the Portable_config/Scripts folder.

I suggest using the combos found in the right click menu or their combos for easiest use.
